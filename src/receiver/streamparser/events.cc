	time computation principles:
	-last_time is always monotonic and is based on pcr
	-a time base discontinuity can be signalled in the stream by having one or more packets
	with discontinuity==1. In this case the new time base comes into effect when such a packet contains
	a pcr.
	-in case packets are lost in the transport stream, this is discovered by continuity
	errors and/or by pcr's which come too early (before the last one) or too late (more than 100 ms
	after the last one). In case the clock could be continuous, but it may also be docontinuous in
	case packets with discontinuity==1 were lost.
	The default is to assume that no discontinuity occured, but we perform some sanity checks:
	-in case of a live stream, the time of reception of the last packet before the loss and the first
	packet after, must match the PCR difference within a tolerance of 30 seconds
	-in case of a non-live stream, the PCR difference must be less than 5 minutes
	If we detect or suspect a discontinuity, we adjust the clock based based on the next received
	video frame (which should come first in normal cases) or audio frame (in case of stream loss),
	which ever comes first
